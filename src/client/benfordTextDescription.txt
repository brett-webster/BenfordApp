Summary:  BenfordApp accesses the SEC’s EDGAR financial data repository via its JSON API in order to screen a company’s public financial statements for potential error or fraud.  It does so by parsing & extracting relevant financial data for a user-designated publicly traded US company.  The app applies the input parameters (company, date range) in order to extract data and then runs and displays an analysis assessing the data’s adherence to Benford’s Law (expected frequency of leading digits).  The chart above graphically summarizes Benford’s Law distribution expectation of leading single digit frequency (adheres to power law, red line) vs. (perfectly even distribution, blue bars).  BenfordApp includes enterprise-grade authentication, log-in flow and database integrity to protect user PII while allowing for permanent data storage of previously analyzed companies.
